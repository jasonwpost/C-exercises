`(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ } `

while the iterator has not reached the end, continue. This wont work as you need `string::iterator iter = .begin()` before.

`(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ }

if (!status) { /* . . . */ }`

This checks the status of a variable word through the find function. However, if(!status) won't work as its outside the scope of status.
