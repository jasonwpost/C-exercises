`(a)for(int ix=0;ix!=sz;++ix) {/* ... */} `

`	if (ix != sz)`

`		// . . .`

while ix is less than sz, increment ix. Problem: if (ix ...) is outside scope of ix.

`(b) int ix; `

`for(ix!=sz;++ix){/* ... */}`

same as above. Problem: initaliser needs a null statement at beginning of for statement.

(c)for(int ix=0;ix!=sz;++ix,++sz) {/*...*/}

same above. Problem: ix will never be teh saem as sz as both are being incremented.

While - as its more flexible.
